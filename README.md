### Building at the Intersection of Scale & Security

I am a Software Engineer focused on building scalable, high-performance backend systems and robust cross-platform applications. With a deep interest in **Systems Architecture** and **Cybersecurity**, I bridge the gap between complex technical requirements and elegant, maintainable code.

With the rise in AI coding agents, the industry is seeing a significant increase in vulnerabilities within generated code. I advocate for a **DevSecOps** approach, ensuring that as development speed increases, security remains a first-class citizen. I write extensively on these topics and document my engineering journey at **[Gazimbi Chronicles](https://www.gazimbi.com/)**.

Beyond engineering, I am a technical educator, sharing deep-dives into software internals and modern development workflows through my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@craiggazimbi).

* **Current Focus:** Deep-diving into Node.js internals, Rust for systems programming, and high-concurrency patterns in Go.
* **Philosophy:** Engineering is about solving business problems with the most efficient tool, not just writing code.
